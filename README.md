# NGX Stock Analysis Dashboard

I created this Power BI dashboard to explore and visualize the performance of selected Nigerian Exchange (NGX) stocks. The goal was to uncover trends, compare companies and sectors, and identify the best-performing stocks over time.  

The dashboard is interactive, allowing users to filter by year, sector, or stock to explore the data from different angles.
